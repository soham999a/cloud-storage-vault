# Vercel Authentication Solution

## Problem Fixed
The Google sign-in functionality was failing on your Vercel deployment with the error message: "Google sign-in failed. Please try again."

## Solution Implemented
I've created a completely new authentication implementation specifically designed for Vercel deployments:

1. **Created a Vercel-specific authentication module**:
   - Added a new `vercel-auth.js` file that handles Google authentication specifically for Vercel
   - This module uses a simplified approach with direct imports and redirect-based authentication
   - It automatically creates user documents in Firestore after successful sign-in

2. **Added automatic detection for Vercel deployments**:
   - The app now detects when it's running on a Vercel domain
   - It automatically loads the Vercel-specific authentication module
   - The Google sign-in buttons use the Vercel-specific authentication when running on Vercel

3. **Created a test page for verification**:
   - Added `vercel-auth-test.html` that you can use to test the Vercel-specific authentication
   - This page provides detailed logging and error messages

## How It Works
When your app is deployed to Vercel:
1. The app detects that it's running on a Vercel domain
2. It loads the Vercel-specific authentication module
3. When a user clicks the Google sign-in button, it uses the Vercel-specific implementation
4. This implementation uses the redirect method, which is more reliable on Vercel
5. After successful sign-in, the user is redirected back to your app

## Important Next Steps

For the fix to work completely, you need to add your Vercel domain to the authorized domains in Firebase:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project "cloud-storage-vault-c9e0c"
3. Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
4. Scroll down to "Authorized domains"
5. Add your Vercel domain (e.g., `cloud-storage-vault.vercel.app`)
6. Also add any preview domains from Vercel (e.g., `cloud-storage-vault-git-main-yourusername.vercel.app`)

## Testing the Solution

1. Visit your Vercel deployment
2. Open the browser console (F12) to see detailed logs
3. Try to sign in with Google
4. You should see logs indicating that the Vercel-specific authentication is being used
5. You should be redirected to Google's sign-in page and then back to your app

If you want to test the Vercel-specific authentication directly, you can visit:
- `https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/vercel-auth-test.html`

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that your Vercel domain is added to Firebase authorized domains
3. Make sure the Firebase project is correctly configured for Google sign-in
4. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies

## Technical Details

The main difference in this implementation is:
1. It uses direct imports from the Firebase CDN
2. It uses a simplified configuration without custom parameters
3. It always uses the redirect method instead of popup
4. It has dedicated error handling for Vercel-specific issues

These changes should resolve the Google sign-in issues on your Vercel deployment.
