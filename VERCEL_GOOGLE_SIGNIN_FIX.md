# Google Sign-In Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Problem Fixed
The Google sign-in functionality was failing on your Vercel deployment with the error message: "Google sign-in failed. Please try again."

## What Was Changed

I've implemented several critical fixes to make Google sign-in work properly on Vercel:

1. **Vercel-Specific Authentication Flow**: 
   - Added detection for Vercel deployments
   - Implemented a direct redirect method for Vercel instead of using popups
   - Created a dedicated redirect handler script

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added better error messages
   - Replaced alerts with non-blocking notifications
   - Added detailed console logging for debugging

3. **Fixed Firebase Configuration**:
   - Removed custom redirect URI that was causing issues
   - Simplified the Google provider configuration
   - Added fallback mechanisms for authentication

4. **Added Redirect Handler Script**:
   - Created a new `redirect-handler.js` file to handle redirect results
   - Implemented automatic checking for redirect results on page load
   - Added user document creation after successful sign-in

## Important Next Steps

For the fix to work completely, you need to add your Vercel domain to the authorized domains in Firebase:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project "cloud-storage-vault-c9e0c"
3. Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
4. Scroll down to "Authorized domains"
5. Add your Vercel domain (e.g., `cloud-storage-vault.vercel.app`)
6. Also add any preview domains from Vercel (e.g., `cloud-storage-vault-git-main-yourusername.vercel.app`)

## How to Test

1. Deploy the updated code to Vercel
2. Open your app on Vercel
3. Try to sign in with Google
4. You should now be redirected to Google's sign-in page and then back to your app

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that your Vercel domain is added to Firebase authorized domains
3. Make sure the Firebase project is correctly configured for Google sign-in
4. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies

## Technical Details

The main change was switching from popup-based authentication to redirect-based authentication for Vercel deployments. This is more reliable for deployed applications, especially on mobile devices.

The code now:
1. Detects if it's running on a Vercel domain
2. Uses the redirect method instead of popup for Vercel
3. Handles the redirect result when the page reloads
4. Creates user documents after successful authentication

These changes should resolve the Google sign-in issues on your Vercel deployment.
